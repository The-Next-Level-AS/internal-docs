# What is Generative UI?

<br />

Generative UI refers to user interfaces that are **dynamically created** or **adapted** in **real-time**. Instead of being pre-designed or static, a generative user interface responds to the **context**, **needs**, or **behaviors** of users.

NXTL is an **LLM-powered** generative UI framework for delivering **data-driven** individualization of digital user experiences.

Before **LLM** systems, generative UI presented a challenge: it would require crafting **a lot of specialized user interfaces**, as well as making sure users were **correctly matched up** with the optimal experience.

With **NXTL** these concerns are **automated** and **abstracted** away. NXTL lets you concentrate on **higher level** matters like: mapping out the **user journeys**, connecting the right **data sources**, and specifying the **signals** that needs to be picked up from the user in order to serve them their generative user experience.
